<h1> My favorite Movie is Fast & Furious </h1> Fast & Furious (also known as The Fast and the Furious) is a media franchise centered on a series of action films that are largely concerned with street racing, heists, spies, and family. The franchise also includes short films, a television series, live shows, toys, video games and theme park attractions.


### why is Fast & Furious is my favorite:
The action star perfectly carried the role of street-racer Dominic Toretto, and the rest is history. The Fast and Furious franchise has given us a lot, but most of all, it's given us Vin Diesel.
